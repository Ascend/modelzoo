Deep learning models are typically trained with floating point data but they can quantized into integers during inference without any loss of performance (i.e. accuracy). Quantizing models includes quantizing both the weights and activation data (or layer input/outputs). In this work, we quantize the floating point weights/activation data to [Qm.n format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format)), where m,n are fixed within a layer but can vary across different network layers. 

## Quantize weights 
Quantizing weights is fairly simple, as the weights are fixed after the training and we know their min/max range. Using these ranges, the weights are quantized or discretized to 256 levels. Here is the code snippet for quantizing the weights and biases to 8-bit integers.
```bash
min_wt = weight.min() 
max_wt = weight.max()
#find number of integer bits to represent this range
int_bits = int(np.ceil(np.log2(max(abs(min_wt),abs(max_wt))))) 
frac_bits = 7-int_bits #remaining bits are fractional bits (1-bit for sign)
#floating point weights are scaled and rounded to [-128,127], which are used in 
#the fixed-point operations on the actual hardware (i.e., microcontroller)
quant_weight = np.round(weight*(2**frac_bits))
#To quantify the impact of quantized weights, scale them back to
# original range to run inference using quantized weights
weight = quant_weight/(2**frac_bits)
```

## Quantize activation data 
One approach for quantizing the activation data is to run inference on some representative input samples (or ideally, the entire dataset) and find the min/max range of each layer input/output. Using these ranges, the activation data can be quantized similar to the weights as shown in the above code snippet. Any outliers in the dataset may increase this range and may impact the accuracy, hence care must be taken in this approach.
Other approach is to insert the TensorFlow Op ["fake_quant_with_min_max_args"](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/fake_quant_with_min_max_args) after every operation (convolution, addition, multiplication or concatenation) and find the optimal power of 2 min,max ranges that maximize the accuracy. This same approach can also be used for quantizing the weights. Furthermore, this modified model with fake_quant_with_min_max_args Op and frozen min,max ranges can be used for retraining/fine-tuning, which may increase the accuracy as the network will adapt to quantization.

## Quantizing KWS models
An example for quantizing DNN model is provided here. [quant_test.py](../quant_test.py) python script generates 8-bit quantized weights from the trained DNN model checkpoint and runs inference using quantized weights and floating-point activations on the entire dataset. It also dumps out the quantized weights into a text file (weights.h) which will be used while generating the binary for the Cortex-M board.
```bash
python quant_test.py --model_architecture dnn --model_size_info 144 144 144 --dct_coefficient_count 10 --window_size_ms 40 \
  --window_stride_ms 40 --checkpoint <path to trained model checkpoint>
```
After quantizing the weights, next step is quantizing the activation data or layer input/outputs. [quant_models.py](../quant_models.py) has fake_quant_with_min_max_args Op inserted with its min/max ranges exposed as commmand line arguments. Optimal activation range that maximizes the accuracy can be progressively determined for each layer starting from the input layer to the output layer. For example, to quantize the neural network input layer data (i.e. MFCC features) to the range [-32,32) while the other layer activations are left as floating point, run `python quant_test.py <model-specific arguments and checkpoint file> --act_max 32 0 0 0 0`. After the activations of all layers are quantized and we are satisfied with the accuracy, the model can be deployed by calling the optimized neural network kernels from [CMSIS-NN](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) with appropriate scaling parameters obtained from the quantization steps. For example, from quantization sweeps we get the input to the first fully-connected layer in DNN model is of Q5.2 format or 2 bits after the decimal point (i.e. ranges from -32,31.75) and the expected output format for maximum accuracy is also Q5.2. Using quant_test.py, we get the quantized weights are of the format Q0.7 (i.e. in range -1,1) and the quantized biases have 8 bits for fractional point (i.e. range -0.5,0.5). So, the product (layer_input x weights) will have 9 bits in the fractional part (Q5.2 x Q0.7 = Qx.9) and biases need to be shifted left by 1 to get to the same representation (i.e. Qx.8<<1 = Qy.9). The layer output has 2 bits for fractional part (Q5.2), so the product (layer_input x weights) needs to be shifted right by 7 to get to Q5.2 format.

## Fusing batch-norm layers
The parameters of batch normalization layers that follow the convolution or fully-connected layers (i.e. mean, variance, scale factor and offset factors: see [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/batch_normalization) for more details) can be fused into the corresponding convn/fc layer weights and biases, which saves both memory and inference time.
```bash
# generate a new checkpoint (*_bnfused) with batch-norm fused to conv/fc layers
python fold_batchnorm.py --model_architecture ds_cnn --model_size_info 5 64 10 4 2 2 64 3 3 1 1 64 3 3 1 1 64 3 3 1 1 64 3 3 1 1 \
  --dct_coefficient_count 10 --window_size_ms 40 --window_stride_ms 20 \
  --checkpoint work/DS_CNN/DS_CNN1/training/best/<checkpoint name>
# continue with quantizing weights and activations as shown in previous steps, but with the new checkpoint
