# Welcome to the Model Zoo for Ascend

In order to facilitate developers to enjoy the benefits of Ascend ModelZoo, we will continue to add typical networks and some of the related pre-trained models. If you have needs for the modelzoo, you can file an issue on [gitee](https://github.com/Ascend/modelzoo/issues) or [ModelZoo](https://bbs.huaweicloud.com/forum/forum-726-1.html), We will consider it in time.

## Contributing

Before you start,Please read the [notice](https://github.com/Ascend/modelzoo/blob/master/contrib/CONTRIBUTING.md)
