## [CRNN Description](#contents)

CRNN was a neural network for image based sequence recognition and its Application to scene text recognition.In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in image-based sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application scenarios.

## [Model Architecture](#content)

CRNN use a vgg16 structure for feature extraction, the appending with two-layer bidirectional LSTM, finally use CTC to calculate loss. See src/crnn.py for details.

## [Dataset](#content)

Note that you can run the scripts based on the dataset mentioned in original paper or widely used in relevant domain/network architecture. In the following sections, we will introduce how to run the scripts using the related dataset below.

We use five datasets mentioned in the paper.For training, we use the synthetic dataset([MJSynth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/) and [SynthText](https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText)) released by Jaderberg etal as the training data, which contains 8 millions training images and their corresponding ground truth words.For evaluation, we use four popular benchmarks for scene text recognition, nalely ICDAR 2003([IC03](http://www.iapr-tc11.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=ICDAR_2003_Robust_Reading_Competitions)),ICDAR2013([IC13](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=2&com=downloads)),IIIT 5k-word([IIIT5k](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/the-iiit-5k-word-dataset)),and Street View Text([SVT](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kai/grocr/)).

### [Dataset Prepare](#content)

For dataset `IC03`, `IIIT5k` and `SVT`, the original dataset from the official website can not be used directly in CRNN.

- `IC03`, the text need to be cropped from the original image according to the words.xml.
- `IIIT5k`, the annotation need to be extracted from the matlib data file.
- `SVT`, the text need to be cropped from the original image according to the `train.xml` or `test.xml`.

We provide `convert_ic03.py`, `convert_iiit5k.py`, `convert_svt.py` as exmples for the aboving preprocessing which you can refer to.

## [Environment Requirements](#contents)

- Hardware（Ascend）
    - Prepare hardware environment with Ascend processor.
- Framework
    - [MindSpore](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore)
- For more information, please check the resources below：
    - [MindSpore Tutorials](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorial/training/en/master/index.html)
    - [MindSpore Python API](https://www.mindspore.cn/doc/api_python/en/master/index.html)

## [Quick Start](#contents)

- After the dataset is prepared, you may start running the training or the evaluation scripts as follows:

    - Running on Ascend

    ```shell
    # distribute training example in Ascend
    $ bash run_distribute_train.sh [DATASET_NAME] [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH]

    # evaluation example in Ascend
    $ bash run_eval.sh [DATASET_NAME] [DATASET_PATH] [CHECKPOINT_PATH] [PLATFORM]

    # standalone training example in Ascend
    $ bash run_standalone_train.sh [DATASET_NAME] [DATASET_PATH] [PLATFORM]

    # offline inference on Ascend310
    $ bash run_infer_310.sh [MINDIR_PATH] [DATA_PATH] [ANN_FILE_PATH] [DATASET] [DEVICE_ID]

    ```

    DATASET_NAME is one of `ic03`, `ic13`, `svt`, `iiit5k`, `synth`.

    For distributed training, a hccl configuration file with JSON format needs to be created in advance.

    Please follow the instructions in the link below:
    [hccl_tools](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/model_zoo/utils/hccl_tools).

- Run on docker

Build docker images(Change version to the one you actually used)

```shell
# build docker
docker build -t ssd:20.1.0 . --build-arg FROM_IMAGE_NAME=ascend-mindspore-arm:20.1.0
```

Create a container layer over the created image and start it

```shell
# start docker
bash scripts/docker_start.sh ssd:20.1.0 [DATA_DIR] [MODEL_DIR]
```

Then you can run everything just like on Ascend.

### [Dataset Preparation](#contents)

- You may refer to "Generate dataset" in [Quick Start](#quick-start) to automatically generate a dataset, or you may choose to generate a text image dataset by yourself.

## [Training Process](#contents)

- Set options in `config.py`, including learning rate and other network hyperparameters. Click [MindSpore dataset preparation tutorial](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorial/training/zh-CN/master/use/data_preparation.html) for more information about dataset.

### [Training](#contents)

- Run `run_standalone_train.sh` for non-distributed training of CRNN model, only support Ascend now.

``` bash
bash run_standalone_train.sh [DATASET_NAME] [DATASET_PATH] [PLATFORM](optional)
```

#### [Distributed Training](#contents)

- Run `run_distribute_train.sh` for distributed training of CRNN model on Ascend.

``` bash
bash run_distribute_train.sh [DATASET_NAME] [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH]
```

Check the `train_parallel0/log.txt` and you will get outputs as following:

```shell
epoch: 10 step: 14110, loss is 0.0029097411
Epoch time: 2743.688s, per step time: 0.097s
```

## [Evaluation Process](#contents)

### [Evaluation](#contents)

- Run `run_eval.sh` for evaluation.

``` bash
bash run_eval.sh [DATASET_NAME] [DATASET_PATH] [CHECKPOINT_PATH] [PLATFORM](optional)
```

Check the `eval/log.txt` and you will get outputs as following:

```shell
result: {'CRNNAccuracy': (0.806)}
```

### Evaluation while training

You can add `run_eval` to start shell and set it True.You need also add `eval_dataset` to select which dataset to eval, and add eval_dataset_path to start shell if you want evaluation while training. And you can set argument option: `save_best_ckpt`, `eval_start_epoch`, `eval_interval` when `run_eval` is True.

## [Inference Process](#contents)

### [Export MindIR](#contents)

```shell
python export.py --ckpt_file [CKPT_PATH] --file_name [FILE_NAME] --file_format [FILE_FORMAT]
```

The ckpt_file parameter is required,
`EXPORT_FORMAT` should be in ["AIR", "MINDIR"]

### Infer on Ascend310

Before performing inference, the mindir file must bu exported by export script on the 910 environment. We only provide an example of inference using MINDIR model.
Current batch_Size can only be set to 1. The inference result will be just the network outputs, which will be save in binary file. The accuracy is calculated by `src/metric.`.

```shell
# Ascend310 inference
bash run_infer_310.sh [MINDIR_PATH] [DATA_PATH] [ANN_FILE_PATH] [DATASET] [DEVICE_ID]
```

`MINDIR_PATH` is the MINDIR model exported by export.py
`DATA_PATH` is the path of dataset. If the data has to be converted, passing the path to the converted data.
`ANN_FILE_PATH` is the path of annotation file. For converted data, the annotation file is exported by convert scripts.
`DATASET` is the name of dataset, which should be in ["synth", "svt", "iiit5k", "ic03", "ic13"]
`DEVICE_ID` is optional, default value is 0.

### result

Inference result is saved in current path, you can find result like this in acc.log file.

```shell
correct num: 2042 , total num: 3000
result CRNNAccuracy is: 0.806666666666
```
