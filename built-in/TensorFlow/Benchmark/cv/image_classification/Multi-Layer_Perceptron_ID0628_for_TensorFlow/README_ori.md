# MultiLayerPerceptron
MLP with Tensorflow and IRIS Dataset 


In this example a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) with an input layer (4 neurons) is implemented a hidden layer (10 neurons) and an output layer for classification into 3 classes (3 neurons). The dataset used contains information on the height and width of the petals and sepals.

The accuracy rate was 98%
