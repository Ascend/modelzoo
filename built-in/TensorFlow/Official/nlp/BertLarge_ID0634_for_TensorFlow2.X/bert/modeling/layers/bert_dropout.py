class Dropout(Layer):
  """Applies Dropout to the input.
  The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of `rate`
  at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
  Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1/(1 - rate) such that the sum over
  all inputs is unchanged.
  Note that the Dropout layer only applies when `training` is set to True
  such that no values are dropped during inference. When using `model.fit`,
  `training` will be appropriately set to True automatically, and in other
  contexts, you can set the kwarg explicitly to True when calling the layer.
  (This is in contrast to setting `trainable=False` for a Dropout layer.
  `trainable` does not affect the layer's behavior, as Dropout does
  not have any variables/weights that can be frozen during training.)

  Arguments:
    rate: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
    noise_shape: 1D integer tensor representing the shape of the
      binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input.
      For instance, if your inputs have shape
      `(batch_size, timesteps, features)` and
      you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps,
      you can use `noise_shape=(batch_size, 1, features)`.
    seed: A Python integer to use as random seed.
  Call arguments:
    inputs: Input tensor (of any rank).
    training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
      training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing nothing).
