## Description

This repository provides a script and recipe to train the Deeplabv3 model. The code is based on tensorflow/models/research/deeplab,
modifications are made to run on NPU
- Deeplabv3 model from: Liang-Chieh Chen et al. "Rethinking Atrous Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation". <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587>.
- reference implementation: <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab>

## Requirements

- Tensorflow NPU environmemnt Pillow.
- Download and preprocess VOC dataset,COCO dataset or SBD dataset for training and evaluation.

## Default configuration

The following sections introduce the default configurations and hyperparameters for Deeplabv3 model. We reproduce two training setups 
on VOC_trainaug datasets, evaluate on four setups. 

For detailed hpyerparameters, please refer to corresponding scripts under directory `scripts/`

### Optimizer

This model uses Momentum optimizer from Tensorflow with the following hyperparameters:

- Momentum : 0.9
- LR schedule: cosine_annealing
- Batch size : 8 * 8   
- Weight decay :  0.0001. 

### Data augmentation

This model uses the following data augmentation:

- For training:
  - RandomResizeCrop, scale=(0.08, 1.0), ratio=(0.75, 1.333)
  - RandomHorizontalFlip, prob=0.5
  - Normalize, mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)
- For inference:
  - Resize to (256, 256)
  - CenterCrop to (224, 224)
  - Normalize, mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)

## Quick start guide

### Prepare the dataset

You can use any datasets as you wish. Here, we only use voc2012_trainaug dataset as an example to illustrate the data generation. 
 - download the voc2012 datasets. 
 - check if `SegmentationClassAug.zip` exists under `datasets/`,if not, you can download Semantic Boundaries Dataset by yourself.
 - txt file named trainaug.txt containing all the seg_image filenames
 - put all three files under `datasets/` directory
 - go the datasets directory and run the script to create tfrecord file. tfrecord file will be saved under `dataset/pascal_voc_seg/tfrecord`
```
cd datasets
convert_voc2012_aug.sh
``` 

For other datasets, you need following three files.  Create a script similar to `convert_voc2012_aug.sh` and 
execute the script when you get all three file ready. 
 - original images
 - voc-style segmentation annotation file
 - txt file for all the seg_image filenames

### check json

Check whether there is a JSON configuration file "8p.json" for 8 Card IP in the scripts/ directory.
The content of the 8p configuration file:
```
{"group_count": "1","group_list":
                    [{"group_name": "worker","device_count": "8","instance_count": "1", "instance_list":
                    [{"devices":
                                   [{"device_id":"0","device_ip":"192.168.100.101"},
                                    {"device_id":"1","device_ip":"192.168.101.101"},
                                    {"device_id":"2","device_ip":"192.168.102.101"},
                                    {"device_id":"3","device_ip":"192.168.103.101"},
                                    {"device_id":"4","device_ip":"192.168.100.100"},
                                    {"device_id":"5","device_ip":"192.168.101.100"},
                                    {"device_id":"6","device_ip":"192.168.102.100"},
                                    {"device_id":"7","device_ip":"192.168.103.100"}],
                                    "pod_name":"npu8p",        "server_id":"127.0.0.1"}]}],"status": "completed"}
```

### Key configuration changes

Before starting the training, first configure the environment variables related to the program running. For environment variable configuration information, see:
- [Ascend 910 environment variable settings](https://gitee.com/ascend/modelzoo/wikis/Ascend%20910%E8%AE%AD%E7%BB%83%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE?sort_id=3148819)

### Running the example

#### Training

All the scripts to tick off the training are located under `scripts/`.  As there are two types of resnet_101 checkpoints exist, original version 
and a so-called beta version available, there are two sets of scripts one for each checkpoint. All the scripts that end with `beta` are meant for 
resnet_v1_101_beta checkpoint. All the scripts that start with `train` are configuration files for the training. You are free to choose either of them as initial checkpoint since they can achieve comparable performance.  

- For resnet_v1_101_beta, you can download by yourself.
- For resnet_v1_101, you can download by yourself.

Create `pretrained/` directory, after you download either checkpoint or both, un-compress the tarball file and put them under `pretrained/` directory.

For instance, to train the model with beta version checkpoints
- with OS=16
    - train on single NPU 
    
        ```
         cd scripts
         ./run_1p_s16_beta.sh
        ```
    - train on 8 NPUs
        ```
         cd scripts
         ./run_s16_beta.sh
        ```
- with OS=8
    - train on single NPU 
    
        ```
         cd scripts
         ./run_1p_s8_beta.sh
        ```
    - train on 8 NPUs
        ```
         cd scripts
         ./run_s8_beta.sh
        ```

***Note***: As the time consumption of the training for single NPU is much higher than that of 8 NPUs, we mainly experiment training using 8 NPUs.

#### Training process

All the results of the training will be stored in the directory `results`.
Script will store:
 - checkpoints
 - log

#### Evaluation

Test results will be saved as log file under `eval/${DEVICE_ID}/resnet_101/training.log`. The value for DEVICE_ID is 
specified in the scripts

- for the model trained with OS=16
```
cd scripts
./test_1p_s16_beta.sh

```
- for the model trained with OS=8
```
cd scripts
./test_1p_s8_beta.sh

```
- for the model trained with OS=8, multi_scale inputs
```
cd scripts
./test_ms_beta.sh

```
- for the model trained with OS=8,multi_scale inputs, random horizontal flip 
```
cd scripts
./test_ms_flip_beta.sh

```
