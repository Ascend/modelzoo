# TensorFlow Natural Language Processing Modelling Toolkit

tensorflow/models/official/nlp provides a [modeling library](modeling) for constructing
NLP model achitectures, as well as TF2 reference implementations for
state-of-the-art models.

The repository contains the following models, with implementations, pre-trained
model weights, usage scripts and conversion utilities:

* [Albert](albert)
* [Bert](bert)
* [NHNet](nhnet)
* [XLNet](xlnet)
* [Transformer for translation](transformer)

Addtional features:

* Distributed trainable on both multi-GPU and TPU
* e2e training for custom models, including both pretraining and finetuning.
