# [NCF Description](#contents)

NCF is a general framework for collaborative filtering of recommendations in which a neural network architecture is used to model user-item interactions. Unlike traditional models, NCF does not resort to Matrix Factorization (MF) with an inner product on latent features of users and items. It replaces the inner product with a multi-layer perceptron that can learn an arbitrary function from data.

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031):  He X, Liao L, Zhang H, et al. Neural collaborative filtering[C]//Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web. 2017: 173-182.


# [Model Architecture](#contents)

Two instantiations of NCF are Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). GMF applies a linear kernel to model the latent feature interactions, and and MLP uses a nonlinear kernel to learn the interaction function from data. NeuMF is a fused model of GMF and MLP to better model the complex user-item interactions, and unifies the strengths of linearity of MF and non-linearity of MLP for modeling the user-item latent structures. NeuMF allows GMF and MLP to learn separate embeddings, and combines the two models by concatenating their last hidden layer. [neumf_model.py](neumf_model.py) defines the architecture details.



# [Dataset](#contents)

The [MovieLens datasets](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) are used for model training and evaluation. Specifically, we use two datasets: **ml-1m** (short for MovieLens 1 million) and **ml-20m** (short for MovieLens 20 million).

### ml-1m
ml-1m dataset contains 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,706 movies made by 6,040 users who joined MovieLens in 2000. All ratings are contained in the file "ratings.dat" without header row, and are in the following format:
```
  UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp
```
  - UserIDs range between 1 and 6040.
  - MovieIDs range between 1 and 3952.
  - Ratings are made on a 5-star scale (whole-star ratings only).

### ml-20m
ml-20m dataset contains 20,000,263 ratings of 26,744 movies by 138493 users. All ratings are contained in the file "ratings.csv". Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:
```
userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
```
  - The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.
  - Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).

In both datasets, the timestamp is represented in seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970. Each user has at least 20 ratings.

# [Features](#contents)

关于特性的相关介绍可以参考https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r0.6/RELEASE.md，以下是混合精度的特性描述。

## Mixed Precision

The [mixed precision](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorial/zh-CN/master/advanced_use/mixed_precision.html) training method accelerates the deep learning neural network training process by using both the single-precision and half-precision data formats, and maintains the network precision achieved by the single-precision training at the same time. Mixed precision training can accelerate the computation process, reduce memory usage, and enable a larger model or batch size to be trained on specific hardware. 
For FP16 operators, if the input data type is FP32, the backend of MindSpore will automatically handle it with reduced precision. Users could check the reduced-precision operators by enabling INFO log and then searching ‘reduce precision’.

## [Training Process](#contents)

### Training 

  ```python
  bash scripts/run_train.sh   
  ```

  The python command above will run in the background, you can view the results through the file `train.log`. After training, you'll get some checkpoint files under the script folder by default. The loss value will be achieved as follows:

  ```python
  # grep "loss is " train.log
  ds_train.size: 95
  epoch: 1 step: 95, loss is 0.25074288
  epoch: 2 step: 95, loss is 0.23324402
  epoch: 3 step: 95, loss is 0.18286772
  ...  
  ```

  The model checkpoint will be saved in the current directory. 





## [Evaluation Process](#contents)

### Evaluation

- evaluation on ml-1m dataset when running on Ascend

  Before running the command below, please check the checkpoint path used for evaluation. Please set the checkpoint path to be the absolute full path, e.g., "checkpoint/ncf-125_390.ckpt".

  ```python
  sh scripts/run_eval.sh   
  ```

  The above python command will run in the background. You can view the results through the file "eval.log". The accuracy of the test dataset will be as follows:

  ```python
  # grep "accuracy: " eval.log
  HR:0.6846,NDCG:0.410
  ```

  # Load unseen dataset for inference
  dataset = dataset.create_dataset(cfg.data_path, 1, False)
  
  # Define model 
  net = GoogleNet(num_classes=cfg.num_classes)
  opt = Momentum(filter(lambda x: x.requires_grad, net.get_parameters()), 0.01,
                 cfg.momentum, weight_decay=cfg.weight_decay)
