# FasterRcnn Description
 
Before FasterRcnn, the target detection networks rely on the region proposal algorithm to assume the location of targets, such as SPPnet and Fast R-CNN. Progress has reduced the running time of these detection networks, but it also reveals that the calculation of the region proposal is a bottleneck.

FasterRcnn proposed that convolution feature maps based on region detectors (such as Fast R-CNN) can also be used to generate region proposals. At the top of these convolution features, a Region Proposal Network (RPN) is constructed by adding some additional convolution layers (which share the convolution characteristics of the entire image with the detection network, thus making it possible to make regions almost costlessProposal), outputting both region bounds and objectness score for each location.Therefore, RPN is a full convolutional network (FCN), which can be trained end-to-end, generate high-quality region proposals, and then fed into Fast R-CNN for detection.

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497):   Ren S , He K , Girshick R , et al. Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks[J]. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2015, 39(6).

# Model Architecture

FasterRcnn is a two-stage target detection network,This network uses a region proposal network (RPN), which can share the convolution features of the whole image with the detection network, so that the calculation of region proposal is almost cost free. The whole network further combines RPN and FastRcnn into a network by sharing the convolution features.

# Dataset

Dataset used: [COCO2017](<http://images.cocodataset.org/>) 

- Dataset size：19G
  - Train：18G，118000 images  
  - Val：1G，5000 images 
  - Annotations：241M，instances，captions，person_keypoints etc
- Data format：image and json files
  - Note：Data will be processed in dataset.py

# Environment Requirements

- Install [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/install/en).

- Download the dataset COCO2017.

- We use COCO2017 as training dataset in this example by default, and you can also use your own datasets.

    1. If coco dataset is used. **Select dataset to coco when run script.**
        Install Cython and pycocotool, and you can also install mmcv to process data.

        ```
        pip install Cython

        pip install pycocotools

        pip install mmcv==0.2.14
        ```
        And change the COCO_ROOT and other settings you need in `config.py`. The directory structure is as follows:


        ```
        .
        └─cocodataset
          ├─annotations
            ├─instance_train2017.json
            └─instance_val2017.json
          ├─val2017
          └─train2017
    
        ```

    2. If your own dataset is used. **Select dataset to other when run script.**
        Organize the dataset infomation into a TXT file, each row in the file is as follows:

        ```
        train2017/0000001.jpg 0,259,401,459,7 35,28,324,201,2 0,30,59,80,2
        ```

        Each row is an image annotation which split by space, the first column is a relative path of image, the others are box and class infomations of the format [xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,class]. We read image from an image path joined by the `IMAGE_DIR`(dataset directory) and the relative path in `ANNO_PATH`(the TXT file path), `IMAGE_DIR` and `ANNO_PATH` are setting in `config.py`. 

# Quick Start

After installing MindSpore via the official website, you can start training and evaluation as follows: 

Note: 1.the first run will generate the mindeocrd file, which will take a long time.
      2.pretrained model is a resnet50 checkpoint that trained over ImageNet2012.
      3.VALIDATION_JSON_FILE is label file. CHECKPOINT_PATH is a checkpoint file after trained. 

```
# standalone training
sh run_standalone_train_ascend.sh [PRETRAINED_MODEL]

# distributed training
sh run_distribute_train_ascend.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [PRETRAINED_MODEL]

# eval
sh run_eval_ascend.sh [VALIDATION_JSON_FILE] [CHECKPOINT_PATH]
```

## Training Process
 
### Usage

```
# standalone training on ascend
sh run_standalone_train_ascend.sh [PRETRAINED_MODEL]

# distributed training on ascend
sh run_distribute_train_ascend.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [PRETRAINED_MODEL]
```
 
> Rank_table.json which is specified by RANK_TABLE_FILE is needed when you are running a distribute task. You can generate it by using the [hccl_tools](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/model_zoo/utils/hccl_tools).
> As for PRETRAINED_MODEL，it should be a ResNet50 checkpoint that trained over ImageNet2012. Ready-made pretrained_models are not available now. Stay tuned.
> The original dataset path needs to be in the config.py,you can select "coco_root" or "image_dir".

### Result
 
Training result will be stored in the example path, whose folder name begins with "train" or "train_parallel". You can find checkpoint file together with result like the followings in loss_rankid.log.
